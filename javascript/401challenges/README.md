# Reverse an Array

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

Instructor worked through whiteboard exercise for class.

# Insert to Middle of an Array

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Approach & Efficiency

Similar to the first challenge. Layed out _Problem Domain_ and the statement to solve. _Visualization_ of the arrays with expected output.

Drew up algorithm and thought about what type of code to use. Decided on a for loop and filtered down until we could come up with the logic to return the modified array.
