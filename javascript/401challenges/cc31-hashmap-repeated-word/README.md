# Challenge Summary

Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
Arguments: string
Return: string

## Approach & Efficiency 

- Worked my way through being able to separate the strings first. 
- Realized late that hash of capital letters are different than lower case and had to rework. Later also realized that commas were part of that as well, so had to figure out a way to filter them out. Then how to output the first iteration was also difficult. 
- I decided that putting all the repeated words into an Array would be a good fit so only returning the first index would return the first repeated words.
- uncomment out the line you wish to run for the string you want the answer to
