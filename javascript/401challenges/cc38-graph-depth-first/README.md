## Approach & Efficiency

Followed lots of the sample code from Ryan. Understanding more on the graph and how to manipulate where we are and have been.

Better understanding of how the process works. Had small mistake which took awhile to find.. The `return visited;` was off a line and that caused nothing to be output. Corrected and working now.
