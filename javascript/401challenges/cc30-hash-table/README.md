# Hash Table

## Challenge

- [CC30](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/5233640/assignments/32144442)

Create Hashtable Class with:

- set
  - Arguments: key, value
  - Returns: nothing
  - This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  - Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
- get
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- has
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- keys
  - Returns: Collection of keys
- hash
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Approach & Efficiency

Lots of following the template from Ryan in Class was super helpful. Figured out the hash and numbers are really just a good way to store that information to make it recallable faster. Each of the methods are listed for the desired output.

### Solution

`node hash-table.js` will return info associated with the Code Challenge.
