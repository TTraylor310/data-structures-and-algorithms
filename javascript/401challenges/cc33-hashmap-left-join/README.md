# Hashmap - Left Join

## Challenge 

[CC33](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/5233640/assignments/32144445)

- Write a function that _LEFT JOINs_ two hashmaps into a single data structure.

    - Write a function called left join
    - Arguments: two hash maps
        - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
        - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    - Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
